# Hubot: YesNoWtf

## Installation

Run the following command to install this module as a Hubot dependency

Add the **hubot-yesnowtf** to your `external-scripts.json` (you may need to create this file).

### Testing locally

You can test this locally by asking hubot a question. The @hubot changes depending on your bot's name.

```
@hubot Will we ever discover the meaning of life?
```

```
@hubot Can I run a database change on production?
```
